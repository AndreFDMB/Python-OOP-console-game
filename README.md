# Python-OOP-console-game

This project will be a simple turn based battle game, run initially on console, to showcase OOP programming in Python, as well as version control.
Players start by choosing their starter chassis and weapon from a limited selection, and then battle randomly generated enemies in turn based combat, picking actions according to their vehicle build and availability in order to defeat their foes and obtain more parts to make better builds.

TO-DO:
-flesh out class and function definitions
-implement basic opponent AI logic
-implement basic game logic
-test out basic game play for bugs
-combat rewards system
-improve action and opponent AI logic for more advanced systems (energy management, healing, dodging etc.)
-implement further game world logic where players can choose which path to take and against which opponents to fight
-boss battles
-multiple opponent battles
