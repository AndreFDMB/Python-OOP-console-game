# Python-OOP-console-game

*This project will be a turn based battle game, run initially on the terminal, to showcase OOP programming in Python, as well as version control and in the near future database generation and maintenance. (Further down the line, it may have actual UI and graphics added.)*

The basic premise is: players build their own vehicles out of a selection of available chassis, each with different stats, equipment mounts and so on, and then assign equipment to the equipmentn slots, each equipment piece enabling an action that the player may take on their turn, whether attacking the opponent, buffing themselves, or healing, among others.
Players start by choosing their starter chassis and weapon from a limited selection, and then battle randomly generated enemies in turn based combat, picking actions according to their vehicle build and availability in order to defeat their foes and obtain more parts to make better builds.

**TO-DO:**
-expand chassis and equipment selection (through a SQLite database and object instance creator script)
-expand events selection (through a JSON database and object instance creator script)
-targetted combat conversion
-time units system instead of turns
-currency system (fuel and scrap)
-repairs
-merchants
-mechbot and its upgrades
-part mod system
-a lote more stuff that will be included as the above is updated
