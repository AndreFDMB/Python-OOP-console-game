# Python-OOP-console-game

This project will be a simple turn based battle game, run initially on the terminal, to showcase OOP programming in Python, as well as version control.
The premise is simple: players build their own vehicles out of a selection of available chassis, each with different stats, equipment mounts and so on, and then assign equipment to the equipmentn slots, each equipment piece enabling an action that the player may take on their turn, whether attacking the opponent, buffing themselves, or healing, among others.
Players start by choosing their starter chassis and weapon from a limited selection, and then battle randomly generated enemies in turn based combat, picking actions according to their vehicle build and availability in order to defeat their foes and obtain more parts to make better builds.

TO-DO:
-expand chassis and equipment selection
-combat rewards system
-improve action and opponent AI logic to accomodate more advanced systems (energy management, healing, dodging etc.)
-implement game world logic where players can choose which path to take and against which opponents to fight
-boss battles
-multiple opponent battles
